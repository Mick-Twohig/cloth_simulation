# Torn Cloth simulation
Simple example using Verlet integration

[Wikipedia article on Verlet Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)

[Example, which uses SFML](https://github.com/FelipesCoding/cloth_simulation/tree/main)

Also used code adapted from [this StackOverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/849211/shortest-distance-between-a-point-and-a-line-segment) to determine nearest constraint to a mouse click. The algorithm I use to determine nearest 
constraint is naive, but the general code for determining distance from line
segment is fine.
